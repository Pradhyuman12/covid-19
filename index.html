            <p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a new coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.
               Because it is a new virus, scientists are learning more each day. Although most people who have COVID-19 have symptoms,
               COVID-19 can also cause severe illness and even death. Some groups, including older adults and people who have certain underlying
               medical conditions, are at increased risk of severe illness.</p>

            <p>Coronaviruses, named for the crown-like spikes on their surfaces, are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many different spe
                cies of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. There are many types of human coronaviruses, including some that commonly cause mild 
                upper-respiratory tract illnesses. COVID-19 is a new disease, caused by a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans.
                <br>Animal coronaviruses rarely infect people and then spread between people. This occurred with two earlier coronaviruses, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.

            <p>SARS-CoV-2 virus is a beta coronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. These viruses have their origins in bats. Although we do not know the exact 
                source of the current outbreak of COVID-19, we know that it originally came from an animal, likely a bat. The sequences from U.S. patients are 
                similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.

            <p>Viruses constantly change through mutation, and new variants of a virus are expected to occur over time. Sometimes new variants emerge and disap-
                -pear. Multiple variants of the virus that causes COVID-19 are circulating globally. In collaboration with a SARS-CoV-2 Interagency Group (SIG), 
                CDC established 3 classifications for the SARS-CoV-2 variants being monitored: Variant of Interest (VOI), Variant of Concern (VOC), and Variant 
                of High Consequence (VOHC). There are currently five VOCs: B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, B.1.427 and B.1.429.

            <p>COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective. Get a COVID-19 vaccine as soon as you can. Widespread vaccination is a critical tool to
               help stop the pandemic.You may have side effects after vaccination. These are normal and should go away in a few days. It typically
               takes two weeks after vaccination for the body to build protection (immunity) against the virus that causes COVID-19. You are not
               fully vaccinated until 2 weeks after the 2nd dose of a two-dose vaccine or two weeks after a one-dose vaccine.

                Two vaccines that have been granted emergency use authorization by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) in India
                are: Covishield® (AstraZeneca's vaccine manufactured by Serum Institute of India) and Covaxin® (manufactured by Bharat Biotech Limited).

                Based on the potential availability of vaccines the Government of India has selected the priority groups who will be vaccinated on priority as t
hey are at higher risk. The first group includes healthcare and frontline workers. The second group to receive COVID-19 vaccine was the persons 
over 60 years of age and persons between 45 and 59 years of age with comorbid conditions. From April 1st, 2021, People above the age of 45 years
(born before 1st Jan, 1977) are eligible to get the COVID-19 vaccine. From May 1, 2021, all eligible citizens above the age of 18 years can get 
the COVID-19 vaccine.
